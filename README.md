TANGUY

A Web Audio Synthesizer by Luke Teaford

I created TANGUY because I'm passionate about Web Audio, and I wanted to bring my enthusiasm to anyone running Chrome. I'm trying to learn JavaScript, so I welcome and appreciate any advice-- especially concerning performance and avoiding repetition.

Thank you, fellow synth geeks.
