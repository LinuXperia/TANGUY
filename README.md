# TANGUY

Web Audio Synthesizer by Luke Teaford. [Play it live at http://tanguysynth.com](http://tanguysynth.com "Luke Teaford's Web Audio Synthesizer")

TANGUY is a two oscillator monosynth built with Web Audio. Various techniques are used to mimic the pleasing characteristics of analogue synthesizers. I made some idiosyncratic decisions about TANGUY to give it a maximum amount of timbral variety and musical applications.

Thank you, fellow synth geeks!
