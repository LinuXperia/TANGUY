TANGUY
======

A Web Audio Synthesizer by Luke Teaford. [Play it live!](http://luketeaford.com/apps/tanguy "Luke Teaford's Web Audio Synthesizer")

Play with the QWERTY keyboard (homerow represents white keys). Shift Octaves with - and +.

I created TANGUY because I'm passionate about Web Audio, and I wanted to bring my enthusiasm to anyone running Chrome (It sounds awful in Firefox). I'm trying to learn JavaScript, so I welcome and appreciate any advice-- especially concerning performance and avoiding repetition.

Thank you, fellow synth geeks.
