#TANGUY

Web Audio Synthesizer by Luke Teaford. [Play it live at http://tanguysynth.com](http://tanguysynth.com "Luke Teaford's Web Audio Synthesizer")

TANGUY is a two oscillator monosynth built with Web Audio. Various techniques are used to mimic the pleasing characteristics of analogue synthesizers. I made some idiosyncratic decisions about TANGUY to give it a maximum amount of timbral variety and musical applications.

##Browser Support:
* Best in Chrome, Opera, and Safari on desktop browsers.
* Works on iPhone5 in Chrome (not Safari)
* Works on iPhone6 and 6+ in Chrome and Safari
* Works on Android devices (but there's a hanging key problem I didn't have time to fix before the WAC)

Thank you, fellow synth geeks!
